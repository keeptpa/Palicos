# Palicos - Yet another Discord bot!

TLDR: This is a program that could play music you want when you chatting in voice channel in Discord. Not only music but more!

# Language
- zh_CN
- en_US
  
# You'll need:

- A windows/Linux/Macos with java runtime.
- Some java knowledge(or read below to get that)
- Internet
- Discord app API key

# Usage
1. Download the jar or build from source yourself, and put it in a folder where there is no other  thing. Because it will produce logs and settings file.
2. Use  
```java -jar .\Palicos.jar <yourDiscordKey> [api.apileague.com/retrieve-random-poem KEY if you need random poem function]```
3. You might want a run.sh or such to kept the key. So you won't type these every time you start Palicos.
4. Now the bot should online, you could use !help to get the command you can use. But later I will prepare some wiki to fully explain these.

# FAQ 
- Q: Why you wrote this? There already tons of discord bot doing such.
- A: Because they are not mine. I prefer a litte bot build by my hand, and build the function for me(or you, my friend.) Indeed I'm noob at both bot and java, and those bot outside might way better that Palico, but still, Palicos and it's function is wrote by my hand, which I enjoy. Besides, I have had serval try of those, they are great, but as far as I could tell none of them as simple and easy as Palicos. Keep it easy, leave joy to users. That's my way. 
- Q: Where do I get my Discord API key
- A: Try google it
- Q: It will be better to have a blahblah feature.
- A: Just issue it. I'll see what I can do for you. But keep in mind, The devenloping speed is base on how much time I spent on Discord. But because **I HAVE NO FRIEND** chat with in Discord. So the devenloping speed might be a pity.
